        <ul>
            <li>Create and assign administrator accounts so admins can easily manage users and devices.</li>
            <li>Create, manage, and view device enrollment user's.</li>
            <li>Identify users and establish permissions using organization groups.</li>
            <li>Group sets of users into user groups which act as filters (in addition to organization groups) for assigning profiles and applications.</li>
            <li>Extract particular values from the devices and return it to Workspace ONE UEM. These attributes can then be associated with other rules to further assign to the devices.</li>
